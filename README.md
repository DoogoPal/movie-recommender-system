# movie-recommender-system
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python that suggests movies to users based on similarity and preference analysis. The system processes movie data, computes similarities, and recommends relevant movies using machine learning techniques.

Features

1) Recommends movies based on user input
2) Uses content-based filtering
3) Data preprocessing with Pandas & NumPy
4) Similarity calculation using Scikit-learn
5) Easy-to-use and customizable

Technologies Used

1) Python
2) Pandas
3) NumPy
4) Scikit-learn
5) Jupyter Notebook

How It Works

1) Load and clean the movie dataset.
2) Convert text features into vectors.
3) Calculate similarity between movies.
4) Recommend top movies based on input. 

Future Improvements

1) Add collaborative filtering
2) Build a web app using Streamlit
3) Improve accuracy with deep learning
